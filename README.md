•EDR stands for Endpoint Detection and Response. It is a cybersecurity approach that focuses on detecting and responding to threats at the endpoint level, such as desktops, laptops, servers, and other network-connected devices. ED solutions provide real-time monitoring and analysis of endpoint activities to identify and respond to security incidents.

They aim to detect and mitigate advanced threats that may have bypassed traditional security measures like firewalls and antivitus software. ED solutions typically offer the following capabilities:

• Endpoint Visibility ED solutions provide comprehensive visibility into endpoint activities, including processes, network connections, and file system changes. This visibility enables security teams to gain insights into the overall security posture and identify potential threats.

• Threat Detection: ED solutions employ advanced techniques, such as behavioral analysis, machine learning, and threat intelligence, to detect malicious activities and anomalous behavior on endpoints. These solutions can identify known malware, as well as detect unknown or zero-day threats.

## Understanding EDR
• Incident Response: When a potential threat or security incident is detected, EDR solutions facilitate quick incident response. They provide capabilities to investigate the incident, analyze the root cause, and determine the extent of the compromise. Some ED solutions also bffer automated response actions to contain and mitigate the impact of the incident.

• Forensic Analysis: DR solutions often include forensic capabilities that allow security teams to gather detailed information about security incidents. This information can be crucial for incident response, threat hunting, and post-incident analysis.

• Threat Hunting: ED solutions enable proactive threat hunting by allowing security analysts to search for indicators of compromise IOCs) or suspiclous activities across endpoints. This approach helos uncover hidden threats that may have evaded initial detection.

• Overall, EDR plays a vital role in enhancing an organization's security posture by providing advanced threat detection, incident response capabilities, and visibilit into endpoint activities. It complements traditional security solutions and helps organizations auicklv identifv and respond to evolving cyber threats.


• SentinelOne ActiveEDRT is an advanced ED and threat hunting solution that delivers real-time visibility with contextualized, correlated insights accelerating triaging and root cause analysis. The solution lightens the SOC burden with automated threat resolution, dramatically reducing the mean time to remediate (MTTR) the incident.
ActiveEDR enables proactive hunting capabilities to uncover stealthy, sophisticated threats lurking in the environment.
