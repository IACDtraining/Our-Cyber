•EDR stands for Endpoint Detection and Response. It is a cybersecurity approach that focuses on detecting and responding to threats at the endpoint level, such as desktops, laptops, servers, and other network-connected devices. ED solutions provide real-time monitoring and analysis of endpoint activities to identify and respond to security incidents.
They aim to detect and mitigate advanced threats that may have bypassed traditional security measures like firewalls and antivitus software. ED solutions typically offer the following capabilities:
• Endpoint Visibility ED solutions provide comprehensive visibility into endpoint activities, including processes, network connections, and file system changes. This visibility enables security teams to gain insights into the overall security posture and identify potential threats.
• Threat Detection: ED solutions employ advanced techniques, such as behavioral analysis, machine learning, and threat intelligence, to detect malicious activities and anomalous behavior on endpoints. These solutions can identify known malware, as well as detect unknown or zero-day threats.
